give me c++ code

Gemini Response:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// --- Example Class ---
class Dog {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    string breed;

public:
    // Constructor
    Dog(string name, int age, string breed) : name(name), age(age), breed(breed) {}

    // Getter methods
    string getName() const { return name; }
    int getAge() const { return age; }
    string getBreed() const { return breed; }

    // Setter methods (optional)
    void setName(string newName) { name = newName; }
    void setAge(int newAge) { age = newAge; }
    void setBreed(string newBreed) { breed = newBreed; }

    // Method to print dog information
    void bark() const {
        cout << "Woof! My name is " << name << ", I am " << age << " years old, and I am a " << breed << "." << endl;
    }

    // Overload the output stream operator (for easy printing)
    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Dog& dog) {
        os << "Name: " << dog.name << ", Age: " << dog.age << ", Breed: " << dog.breed;
        return os;
    }
};

// --- Example Function ---
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// --- Example Function using Vectors ---
vector<int> findEvenNumbers(const vector<int>& numbers) {
    vector<int> evenNumbers;
    for (int num : numbers) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            evenNumbers.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    return evenNumbers;
}

// --- Example Function using Algorithms ---
int findMax(const vector<int>& numbers) {
    if (numbers.empty()) {
        return -1; // Or throw an exception, depending on your needs
    }
    return *max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
}


int main() {
    // --- Example Usage ---

    // 1. Basic Output
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;

    // 2. Using the add function
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    cout << "The sum of 5 and 3 is: " << sum << endl;

    // 3. Working with the Dog class
    Dog myDog("Buddy", 5, "Golden Retriever");
    myDog.bark();
    cout << "Dog details: " << myDog << endl; // Using the overloaded output stream operator

    // 4. Using the findEvenNumbers function
    vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    vector<int> evenNumbers = findEvenNumbers(numbers);
    cout << "Even numbers: ";
    for (int num : evenNumbers) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // 5. Using the findMax function
    int maxNumber = findMax(numbers);
    cout << "Maximum number: " << maxNumber << endl;

    // 6. Get user input
    string name;
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    getline(cin, name); // Use getline to read a line of input (handles spaces)
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Example:** This code provides a good starting point with several examples.  It demonstrates:
    * Basic output (`cout`)
    * Functions (with parameters and return values)
    * Classes (with constructors, methods, getters, setters, and output stream overloading)
    * Vectors (dynamic arrays)
    * Algorithms (using `max_element`)
    * User input (`cin` and `getline`)

* **Clear Structure:** The code is organized into logical sections:
    * Header includes
    * Example class definition
    * Example function definitions
    * `main` function (containing the example usage)

* **`Dog` Class Explanation:**
    * **Encapsulation:**  The `name`, `age`, and `breed` members are `private`, meaning they can only be accessed and modified through the class's methods (getters and setters).  This protects the data.
    * **Constructor:** The `Dog(string name, int age, string breed)` is the constructor.  It's called when you create a `Dog` object.  The `: name(name), age(age), breed(breed)` part is an *initializer list*, which is the preferred way to initialize member variables in a constructor (more efficient).
    * **Getters (Accessors):** `getName()`, `getAge()`, and `getBreed()` are getter methods. They allow you to retrieve the values of the private member variables.  They are marked `const` because they don't modify the object's state.
    * **Setters (Mutators):** `setName()`, `setAge()`, and `setBreed()` are setter methods. They allow you to modify the values of the private member variables.  These are optional; whether you include them depends on whether you want to allow external modification of the object's data.
    * **`bark()` Method:** A simple method to demonstrate behavior.
    * **Output Stream Overloading (`operator<<`)**: This is a *very* useful technique.  It allows you to easily print a `Dog` object to the console using `cout << myDog;`.  The `friend` keyword is needed because the operator function is defined outside the class, but it needs access to the class's private members.  It returns an `ostream&` so you can chain output operations (e.g., `cout << myDog << " something else";`).

* **`findEvenNumbers` Function:** Demonstrates how to work with vectors and loops.  It efficiently iterates through the input vector and adds even numbers to a new vector.

* **`findMax` Function:** Uses the `max_element` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header to find the maximum element in a vector. This is a more efficient and concise way to find the maximum than writing a manual loop. The `*` dereferences the iterator returned by `max_element` to get the actual value.

* **`getline` for User Input:**  Using `getline(cin, name)` is *crucial* when reading strings from the console that might contain spaces.  `cin >> name` would only read up to the first space.

* **Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain each part.

* **Error Handling (Basic):** The `findMax` function includes a basic check for an empty vector and returns -1 in that case.  In a real-world application, you might throw an exception instead.

* **`using namespace std;`:**  While commonly used in small examples, be aware that using this statement in larger projects can lead to naming conflicts. Consider using `std::cout`, `std::vector`, etc., to be more explicit.

How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.cpp` file (e.g., `example.cpp`).

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ example.cpp -o example
   ```

3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./example
   ```

This will print the output of the program to your console.  You can then experiment with the code, modify it, and add your own features. Remember to recompile after making changes.
