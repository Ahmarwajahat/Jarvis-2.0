Prompt:
give me information of trees in DSA in 10 lines

Response:
*   Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges.
*   A tree has a root node, and nodes can have children.
*   Binary trees have at most two children per node (left and right).
*   Common tree types include Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL trees, and B-trees.
*   BSTs maintain sorted order for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
*   Tree traversal algorithms include preorder, inorder, and postorder.
*   Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, organize data, and implement search algorithms.
*   Balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black) prevent worst-case scenarios and ensure logarithmic time complexity.
*   Applications: file systems, databases (indexing), decision trees, and expression parsing.
*   Height and depth are important properties for analyzing tree performance.
