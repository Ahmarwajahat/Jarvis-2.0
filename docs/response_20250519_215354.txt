Prompt:
tell me about psl

Gemini Response:
PSL can refer to a few things. To give you the most helpful information, I need a little more context.  Are you interested in:

*   **Pakistan Super League (PSL):** This is the most common usage. It's a professional Twenty20 cricket league in Pakistan. If this is what you're interested in, I can provide details about the teams, history, format, star players, recent seasons, broadcasting rights, and more.

*   **Professional Services Library (PSL):** This is a library for managing and delivering professional services.

*   **Problem Solving Language (PSL):** This is a family of domain-specific languages used in various problem-solving applications.

*   **Pressure Sensitive Label (PSL):** This is an adhesive label that can be applied with pressure.

Please clarify which PSL you're curious about, or give me some context so I can tailor my response to your needs. For example, you could say:

*   "Tell me about the Pakistan Super League."
*   "I'm interested in learning about the Pakistan Super League teams."
*   "What is the Pakistan Super League?"
*   "What is PSL in the context of professional services?"

Once you tell me which PSL you mean, I can give you a detailed and relevant answer.
