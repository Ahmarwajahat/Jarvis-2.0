Prompt:
give me python simple code

Gemini Response:
```python
def greet(name):
  """Greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Get the user's name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Call the greet function
greet(user_name)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def greet(name):`**: This defines a function named `greet` that takes one argument, `name`.
2. **`"""Greets the person passed in as a parameter."""`**: This is a docstring, a multiline string that describes what the function does. It's good practice to include docstrings for clarity.
3. **`print(f"Hello, {name}!")`**: This line uses an f-string (formatted string literal) to create a greeting message that includes the value of the `name` variable.  `f"..."` allows you to embed expressions directly within the string using curly braces `{}`.
4. **`user_name = input("Enter your name: ")`**: This line prompts the user to enter their name using the `input()` function. The text inside the parentheses is the prompt that will be displayed to the user. The user's input is then stored in the `user_name` variable.
5. **`greet(user_name)`**: This line calls the `greet` function, passing the `user_name` variable as an argument.  This will execute the code inside the `greet` function, printing the personalized greeting.

**How to run this code:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the code in a file named, for example, `greeting.py`.
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt:**
3. **Navigate to the directory where you saved the file:**  Use the `cd` command (change directory) to navigate to the correct location.
4. **Run the code:** Type `python greeting.py` and press Enter.

The program will then ask you for your name and print a personalized greeting.
